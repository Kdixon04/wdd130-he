            <p> Dectective Conan is a nationally beloved animation, created by Gosho Aoyama in 1994
                and launched in 1996. Like many fans, visiting Jpan had been my childhood dream for over a decade.
                Conan Town, located in Aoyama's hometown of Tottori Prefecture, Japan is an absolute must-see site 
                for all Conan fans. I'm excited to share the details of my personal pilgrimage there in October 2024.
